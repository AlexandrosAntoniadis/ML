Python script and files for Machine Learning

mynewml.py is the machine learning algorithm. I use explanatory comments inside. For further questions, contact me at alexandros.antoniadis@astro.up.pt

EW&Par.csv is the file that contains the stars, the lines, the EWs, the Teff and [Fe/H] for the M-dwarf stars I have calculated. It is used as the sample for training and testing the model for M-dwarfs.

EWnewstar.csv is the file that contains the EWs I measured for a random M-dwarf star, in order to obtain its (unknown) Teff and [Fe/H] applying the Machine Learning model that was created and saved from the process above.
